# ex02_ooo: Is execution out of order? (10 points)

Status: [ ] code written  [ ] tested locally  [ ] run on both required machines (all 8 if doing the bonus)  [ ] >=3 repeats
        [ ] enclave run (or limitation documented)  [ ] plots  [ ] in report

## Planned method
Place independent work after a cache-missing load. If the runtime does not grow with the amount of independent filler (up to a point), later instructions executed past the stalled load. Control: make the filler **depend** on the load; then time should grow with the filler. Same timing harness as ex04.

## What to measure / expected shape
Flat time vs filler for independent work until the window fills (this knee is the ROB experiment, ex04), linear growth for dependent work. The two curves side by side are the evidence.

(Expectations are hypotheses to check against your data, not results to quote.)

## Evidence rules (course)
- Primary evidence is **timing only**. Hardware counters may be used afterwards, clearly labeled as a double-check.
- Hybrid CPUs: test both P-cores and E-cores. Fixed frequency is allowed only with coordination, and must be restored.
- Separate measured findings from published specifications in the report.

## Contract with scripts/fleet.sh
`run.sh` reads env `CORE` and `LABEL` (plus optional tuning variables), pins to `CORE`, and writes
`results/<host>_<label>_hp<HP>_<runid>/` containing `run_config.txt` (`core= label= hp= run=`), the raw CSV(s),
summaries/plots, and `sysinfo/` (call `../common/gather_info.sh`). Use `../common/include/bench_common.h` for timing helpers.
See `exercises/ex04_rob/run_rob.sh` for a complete example.
